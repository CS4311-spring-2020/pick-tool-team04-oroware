Netgraph
========

Summary:
--------
Module to plot weighted, directed graphs of medium size (10-100 nodes).
Unweighted, undirected graphs will look perfectly fine, too, but this module
might be overkill for such a use case.

Raison d'Ãªtre:
--------------
Existing draw routines for networks/graphs in python use fundamentally different
length units for different plot elements. This makes it hard to
    - provide a consistent layout for different axis / figure dimensions, and
    - judge the relative sizes of elements a priori.
This module amends these issues.

Furthermore, this module allows to tweak node positions using the
mouse after an initial draw.

Example:
--------
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt; plt.ion()
import netgraph

# construct sparse, directed, weighted graph
# with positive and negative edges
n = 20
w = np.random.randn(n,n)
p = 0.2
c = np.random.rand(n,n) <= p
w[~c] = 0.

# plot
netgraph.draw(w)

# If no node positions are explicitly provided (via the `node_positions` argument to `draw`),
# netgraph uses a spring layout to position nodes (Fruchtermann-Reingold algorithm).
# If you would like to manually tweak the node positions using the mouse after the initial draw,
# use the InteractiveGraph class:

graph = netgraph.InteractiveGraph(w)

# The new node positions can afterwards be retrieved via:
pos = graph.node_positions

# IMPORTANT NOTE:
# You must retain a reference to the InteractiveGraph instance at all times (here `graph`).
# Otherwise, the object will be garbage collected and you won't be able to alter the node positions interactively.
